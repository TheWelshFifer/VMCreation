Lab VMs
==========
The purpose of this project is to create a PowerShell function to provision VMs based of a Sysprep image.

As it stands, I have added some basic error checking and verification steps.

Would like to add logging and support for additional images. (currently a static reference to a 2012R2 Sysprep image).
